# Changes

As of 2/7/2022, we are uploading a separate database for each serial interval option: 

  - The file "Database_X" contains the Rt estimates for a serial interval equal to X days.
  - The file "Database" contains the whole set of estimates.

## Variables Included

Country/Region

Date

R: contains the median estimate for Rt

CI_95_u: Upper limit 95% credible interval

CI_95_l: Lower limit 95% credible interval

CI_65_u: Upper limit 65% credible interval

CI_65_l: Lower limit 65% credible interval

Days_infectious: Serial interval for Covid-19. We provide a range from 5 to 10 days. An extense discussion on the effect of changing the serial interval can be found on the paper. Recent studies find that estimates of the serial interval for COVID-19 range between 4 and 9 days (Nishiura et al.,2020b;Park et al.,2020;Sanche et al.,2020). We suggest using 7 days (the average of the range) as point of reference.
